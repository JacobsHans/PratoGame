## Welcome to the Prato Game github

The [Prato Game](http://game.prato.be/) is a game by developers and for developers. I setup the ground work for a game where you can simply complete levels as the game throws them at you or you can hack/expand/use the game in other ways as you desire.
You can download the source here and start enhancing/expanding the game immediately.
I cannot wait to see what you guys come up with.

It would be cool if you could make a post on [this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PratoGame/) for every discovery/hack/expansion of the game that you find. Then everyone can try it out, rate it or make an expansion of your expansion etc... You get the picture ;-)

Happy coding! :-D
